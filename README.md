# game-nuggets
Repository for unpolished or half completed video games

# Changelog

* 2017/02/20 - Decided that I had too many stranded repositories in git that have no future but I don't want to delete. Created this repo for future nuggets that don't require their own repo, but I want to store somewhere.
